     <h3> <u>LG</u> Corporation was established as Lak Hui Chemical Industrial Corp.
      in 1947 by Koo In-hwoi.[4] In 1952, Lak Hui (락희) (pronounced "Lucky";
      now <u>LG</u> Chem) became the first South Korean company to enter the
      plastics industry. As the company expanded its plastics business, it
      established GoldStar Co. Ltd. (now <u>LG</u> Electronics Inc.) in 1958.
      Both companies Lucky and GoldStar merged to form Lucky-Goldstar in
      1983.[5] GoldStar produced South Korea's first radio.[5] Many consumer
      electronics were sold under the brand name GoldStar, while some other
      household products (not available outside South Korea) were sold under the
      brand name of Lucky. The Lucky brand was famous for hygiene products such
      as soaps and HiTi laundry detergents, but the brand was mostly associated
      with its Lucky and Perioe toothpaste. <u>LG</u> continues to manufacture
      some of these products for the South Korean market, such as laundry
      detergent.</h3>
